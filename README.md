MinimalCDIServlet
=================

Getting started with CDI in Tomcat 7.

If you're puzzled by the missing Maven or Gradle build file: this is simply an exploded Tomcat folder.
Simply put the project into Tomcat's webapp folder, make sure the classes are compiled into
WEB-INF/classes and everything should run just fine.

The project consists of a little servlet that's available at <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8080/MinimalCDIServlet/testcdi">http://127.0.0.1:8080/MinimalCDIServlet/testcdi</a>.

This project is a slightly adapted version of http://www.byteslounge.com/tutorials/configuring-cdi-with-tomcat-example,
which is also available on GitHub (https://github.com/him-bhar/cdi-samples/tree/master/com-byteslounge-cdi).
